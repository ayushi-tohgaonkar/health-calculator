        <pre
          style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 20px;">BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight,
   and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight
    for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is
     underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. 
     These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories
      such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects,
       so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing
     or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that is used by the calculator.</pre>

        <h1 style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 50px;"><b>Risks associated with being overweight</b></h1>
        <pre
          style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 20px;"><b>Being overweight increases the risk of a number of serious diseases
       and health conditions. Below is a list of said risks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):</b>

     1. High blood pressure
     2. Higher levels of LDL cholesterol, which is widely considered "bad cholesterol," lower levels of HDL cholesterol,
        considered to be good cholesterol in moderation, and high levels of triglycerides
     3. Type II diabetes
     4. Coronary heart disease
     5. Stroke
     6. Gallbladder disease
     7. Osteoarthritis, a type of joint disease caused by breakdown of joint cartilage
     8. Sleep apnea and breathing problems
     9.Certain cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, liver)
     10. Low quality of life
     11. Mental illnesses such as clinical depression, anxiety, and others
     12. Body pains and difficulty with certain physical functions
     13. Generally, an increased risk of mortality compared to those with a healthy BMI


      As can be seen from the list above, there are numerous negative, in some cases fatal, outcomes that may result 
      from being overweight. Generally, a person should try to maintain a BMI below 25 kg/m2, but ideally should consult 
      their doctor to determine whether or not they need to make any changes to their lifestyle in order to be healthier.</pre>

        <h1 style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 50px;"><b>Risks associated with being underweight</b></h1>
        <pre style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 20px;"><b>Being underweight has its own associated risks, listed below:</b>

     1. Malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, anemia (lowered ability to carry blood vessels)
     2. Osteoporosis, a disease that causes bone weakness, increasing the risk of breaking a bone
     3. A decrease in immune function
     4. Growth and development issues, particularly in children and teenagers
     5. Possible reproductive issues for women due to hormonal imbalances that can disrupt the menstrual cycle.
       Underweight women also have a higher chance of miscarriage in the first trimester
     6. Potential complications as a result of surgery
     7. Generally, an increased risk of mortality compared to those with a healthy BMI


      In some cases, being underweight can be a sign of some underlying condition or disease such as anorexia nervosa,
       which has its own risks. Consult your doctor if you think you or someone you know is underweight, particularly 
       if the reason for being underweight does not seem obvious.</pre>

        <h1 style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 50px;"><b>Tips for Maintaining a Healthy BMI</b></h1>
        <pre style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 20px;"><b>
  1.Get—and stay—active:</b> Exercise sounds unpleasant, but it’s a crucial part of maintaining a healthy BMI.
       It doesn’t necessarily have to be miserable either. If you can find a sport or vigorous outdoor activity you enjoy 
       doing, it will be much easier to keep your body mass down.
     
  <b >2. Avoid random snacking:</b> Random snacking throughout the day, or grazing, is a major culprit for weight gain.
   Limit eating to set mealtimes, and control portion sizes. It helps to eliminate snack foods from your home so that the
    temptation isn’t there.
      
  <b> 3.Cut out high calorie drinks:</b> Drinks that are high in sugar or calories are another major cause of weight gain.
   Keep these beverages to a minimum, and drink more water. This will not only help maintain your BMI, but it will keep you 
   better hydrated as well since many high-calorie drinks actually dehydrate you.
     
  <b> 4.Eat healthy:</b> Eating healthy food and cutting out junk sounds hard, but there are many recipes out there that
   allow you to eat healthily without any hassle. Increase fruit and vegetable intake, decrease harmful fats, and you’ll 
   be able to maintain your BMI while also enjoying more energy and better organ function.</pre>
